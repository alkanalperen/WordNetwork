# WordNetwork
The goal of this project is to perform some graph-related operations on Prof. Donald
Knuth’s list of five-letter words in GraphBase (Donald E. Knuth, “The Stanford GraphBase: A Platform for Combinatorial Computing,” ACM Press, New York, 1993). In this
data set, each word is a vertex and two vertices are connected by an undirected edge if the
corresponding words differ in only one letter.
